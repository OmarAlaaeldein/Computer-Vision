# Computer Vision CSE 429 Labs

Useful notebooks that covers introductory concepts in Computer Vision and Machine Learning

## Description

This repository cover many concepts like:
* PCA, finding Eigenfaces of a collection of images
* Implementation of Zhang-Seunâ€™s Thinning algorithm, for thinning and extract the skelton of an object
* Histogram Equalization, Binary Image Thresholding, and Image Clustering using K-means
* Image Denoising using filters and Gausian Pyramids
* Implementing a Neural Network with customizable layers and activation functions from Scratch using OOP
* Implementing K-means from scratch using OOP
